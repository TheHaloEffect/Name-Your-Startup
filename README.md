# Name Your Startup

### App Link: https://name-your-startup.netlify.app/

## Description
- A React web app that takes in user input and generates startup name ideas from that. 
- It is responsive and available as a Progressive Web App. Names can be saved and these are stored in LocalStorage. 
- Names retrieved from the NPM package [@rstacruz/startup-name-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rstacruz/startup-name-generator)
- This was made to practice my React skills, making good use of components and hooks.

## How it Works
- Type in the search bar to generate real-time name ideas
- Click on name to save it, click again to remove it
